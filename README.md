Hello there, this is a simple Hangman-Game developed as a task given by Parafuso as my second deliverable to the ITAJUNIOR trainee.
The game itself is very simple, it runs on terminal and it'll use a 'library' of words and contexts that can be acessed in the .txt file
to choose, randomly, using the basic random library from python, a word to be guessed.
